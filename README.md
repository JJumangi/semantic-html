# **Semantic HTML Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to polish this doc's code to utlize semantic tagging of the HTML language. (Changed containers to proper and logical HTML semantic language)
* I was also attempting to provide more accessability to this webpage by creating alternative text's for each image on the page.
